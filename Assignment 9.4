9.4 Write a program to read through the mbox-short.txt and figure out who has sent the greatest number of mail messages. 
The program looks for 'From ' lines and takes the second word of those lines as the person who sent the mail. 
The program creates a Python dictionary that maps the sender's mail address to a count of the number of times they appear in the file. 
After the dictionary is produced, the program reads through the dictionary using a maximum loop to find the most prolific committer.

name = input("Enter file:")
if len(name) < 1 : name = "mbox-short.txt"
handle = open(name)
count = dict()
lst = list()
for line in handle:
    line.rstrip()
    words = line.split()
    if len(words) < 3 or words[0]!="From":
            continue
    lst.append(words[1])
for word in lst:
    if word not in count:
        count[word] = count.get(word,0)+1
    else:
        count[word] = count[word] + 1
bigcount = None
bigword = None
for word,count in count.items():
    if bigcount is None or count > bigcount:
        bigcount = count
        bigword = word
print(bigword,bigcount)
